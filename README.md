# Barker - the Dog Tinder App

Welcome to Barker, a simple app to help you and your best bud find and match with nearby playdates. Check out the live demo [here](heroku link)!

## Functionality



## Getting Started

To run the application locally, first clone this repository to your computer using the following command:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/awberez/dog-tinder.git
```

Assuming mySQL is installed, navigate to `/dog-tinder/config` and edit the `config.json` file to incorporate your own mySQL password.

Navigate to the generated folder and run the following command twice, once in the main directory and once within the `/dog-tinder/client` folder.

```
$ yarn install
```

After running 'yarn install' in both of those folders, navigate back to the main folder and run:

```
$ yarn start
```

From there the application will automatically open in your default internet browser, ready to use!
